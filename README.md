# .layer community

Welcome to the .layer community-tasks repo! This repo aims to centralize all the tasks that need to be done for the community as a whole.

## Who we are

.layer is basically an open-source minded platform/community in which everyone shares a common passion for data science and machine learning. The community doesn't have leaders or hierarchy of any kind. It's just a bunch of people believing in free collaborative work where all deliberately act as contributors to each other ideas and projects. The .layer community is nothing but its members who together form ideas, relationships and dreams.

## What we do

The community is all about working on collaborative projects and spreading knowledge. The collaborative part is continually done through developping and sharing ideas/projects with each others. The education part (spreading knowledge) is done in many ways and is not only oriented towards its members, but also shared to society as whole. These two components are detailed below.

### Collaborative working

The goal of the community is to give us a plateform and opportunities for engaging in different collaborative projects. This is done on continuous basis, as anybody can contribute and bring its own taste to someone else's project. Thereby, it's important to promote sharing of ideas and open mindedeness regarding each other. As ironic as it might seem, we believe that individual empowerment comes through a collective-oriented lifestyle.

To ultimately accomplish that goal, we adopt an inclusive attitude and promote diversity towards our skills set, our cultures and all other forms.

### Spreading knowledge

This is a crucial aspect in the philosophy behind the community. It is split in two parts.

First, there is the education found and provided by the community members directly. This is done through the organization of meetings and blog posts where all members are encouraged to share any kind of knowledge/discovery/perspective/idea related to data science, machine learning and statistics (whether or not they think these are all one and the same).

Second, there is this crazy idea that all this boiling knowledge should benefit the society as a whole. This can be done through the publication of papers, articles, blog or visualisations techniques that ultimately aims at informing others on particular issues and making key concepts easy to understand for the population in general.
